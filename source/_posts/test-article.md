### Softwae testing

Software testing is the act of checking whether software satisfies expectations.

Software testing can provide objective, independent information about the quality of software and the risk of its failure to a user or sponsor.

Software testing can determine the correctness of software for specific scenarios, but cannot determine correctness for all scenarios.It cannot find all bugs.

Based on the criteria for measuring correctness from an oracle, software testing employs principles and mechanisms that might recognize a problem. Examples of oracles include: specifications, contracts, comparable products, past versions of the same product, inferences about intended or expected purpose, user or customer expectations, relevant standards, applicable laws.
