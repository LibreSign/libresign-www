## Common problems in document management

Document management faces several common issues. Manual document signing can take days or even weeks, especially when multiple signatures are needed, delaying important processes and affecting the institution's operations. Moreover, manual handling of documents increases the chance of errors, leading to legal and administrative problems. The use of paper, printing, storage, and sending physical documents also generates significant costs for institutions. Finally, ensuring data security and compliance with laws, such as the LGPD (General Data Protection Law), is a constant challenge.

### Real problem: Floods in Rio Grande do Sul

A recent example that highlights the importance of document digitization is the floods in Rio Grande do Sul. Many schools and universities lost important physical documents due to the floods, resulting in enormous losses and difficulties in recovering essential information. The lack of digitization severely affected the administration and continuity of educational activities. This tragic event reinforces the urgent need to adopt digital solutions to protect important data and ensure the resilience of institutions against natural disasters.
