### Growing demand for digital subscriptions points to a promising market for the cooperative in 2025

With the aim of impacting people's lives by simplifying technology processes and guaranteeing security with meaningful connections, the LibreCode cooperative has as its flagship a platform for digital signatures called LibreSign. This platform provides accessible and collaborative solutions that allow the client to have technological autonomy. Among the main features of this tool is agility and security in digital signature and document management. LibreSign has features that adapt to the specific needs of each organization.

According to research by Advanced Consulting, the Information Technology (IT) market closed the second quarter of 2024 with 22% growth, and should continue to evolve in 2025. According to the CryptoID portal, the digital signature market has been growing rapidly with a projection of surpassing the R$ 300 billion mark by 2030, representing one of the most promising economic drivers of this decade. This phenomenon has occurred due to the need to migrate from analog processes to more agile, economical and secure digital approaches, especially after the Covid pandemic stimulated the move to remote working environments.
“We have noticed an increase in demand for specialized IT services, due to the desire of people and companies to seek innovation and efficiency through the adoption of technological solutions developed by cooperatives, which have a positive social impact on their activities and data security,” says the president of the LibreCode cooperative, Daiane Alves.

For Daiane, challenges are transformed into opportunities with tools that help customers achieve their goals autonomously and efficiently. “At the end of the day, it's not just about using technology, but about how it can make life more connected and human. That's what drives us,” he says.

### LibreSign: cooperative technology

LibreSign's differential is that it offers solutions based on free software, guaranteeing customers sovereignty over the technology they use. “The platform focuses on customization and accessibility, which serves both small businesses and large organizations and governments. The platform is aligned with Brazilian legal compliance, such as LGPD GDPR and ICP-Brasil,” he explains.

Customer Iván Gómez Fernández, Construction Engineer, highlights the autonomy, simplicity, accessibility and support of the LibreSign team. “It works perfectly with the electronic certificate issued by the Spanish government. Installation is very simple and accessible for anyone with minimal knowledge of Nextcloud. The developer support is fantastic. It works on all devices, including mobile devices,” he says.
