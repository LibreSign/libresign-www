    "## Common problems in document management\n\nDocument management faces several common issues. Manual document signing can take days or even weeks, especially when multiple signatures are needed, delaying important processes and affecting the institution's operations. Moreover, manual handling of documents increases the chance of errors, leading to legal and administrative problems. The use of paper, printing, storage, and sending physical documents also generates significant costs for institutions. Finally, ensuring data security and compliance with laws, such as the LGPD (General Data Protection Law), is a constant challenge.\n\n### Real problem: Floods in Rio Grande do Sul\n\n![Image](../assets/images/floods-in-rio-grande-do-sul.png)\n\nA recent example that highlights the importance of document digitization is the floods in Rio Grande do Sul.

This method requires users to provide two or more forms of verification before accessing documents, making the signing process more secure and reliable.\n\nFor example, in addition to the password, a code sent to the user's cell phone or email may be required. This additional level of verification prevents unauthorized people from forging signatures or accessing important documents. For public organizations, where accuracy and accountability are paramount, MFA provides an indispensable extra layer of security.\n\n### The importance of digital security in public companies\nPublic companies deal daily with information that requires the highest level of security. From contracts and agreements to legislative documents and citizen records, protecting this data is crucial. Any security breach can result in serious consequences, including data loss, unauthorized access to sensitive information and damage to the organization's reputation.\n\nLibreSign was developed with a focus on security and efficiency.

    "### The beginning of the modern co-operative movement\n\nThe earliest record of a co-operative comes from Fenwick, Scotland where, in March 14, 1761, in a barely furnished cottage local weavers manhandled a sack of oatmeal into John Walker's whitewashed front room and began selling the contents at a discount, forming the Fenwick Weavers' Society.\n\nThere are a plethera of records of co-operatives started out as small grassroots organisations in Western Europe, North America and Japan in the middle of the nineteenth century, however, it is the Rochdale Pioneers that are generally regarded as the prototype of the modern co-operative society and the founders of the Co-operative Movement in 1844.An independently formulated co-operative model developed in Germany by Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen and Franz Hermann Schultz-Delitsch. Raiffeisen and Schultz-Delitsch originally formed credit unions in 1862. Since then the model has grown into other sectors and inspired the growth of financial co-operatives across the world.\n\n### The co-operative movement today\n\nThe principles that underpinned co-operatives' way of doing business are still accepted today as the foundations upon which all co-operatives operate. These principles have been revised and updated, but remain essentially the same as those practiced by the Pioneers in 1844.\n\nToday the sector is estimated to have around 1 billion members. Co-operatives employ, directly or indirectly, 250 million people around the world. The world's top 300 co-operatives by themselves have an estimated global turnover of 2.2 trillion USD, as revealed by the 2014 World Co-operative Monitor. \n\n### The International Co-operative Alliance\n\nThe International Co-operative Alliance was founded in London, England on 19 August 1895 during the 1st Co-operative Congress. In attendance were delegates from co-operatives from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, England, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, India, Italy, Switzerland, Serbia, and the USA. Representatives established the Alliance's aims to provide information, define and defend the Co-operative Principles and develop international trade. The Alliance was one of the only international organisations to survive both World War I and World War II. Overcoming all the political differences between its members was difficult, but the Alliance survived by staying committed to peace, democracy, and by remaining politically neutral.": "### The beginning of the modern co-operative movement\n\nThe earliest record of a co-operative comes from Fenwick, Scotland where, in March 14, 1761, in a barely furnished cottage local weavers manhandled a sack of oatmeal into John Walker's whitewashed front room and began selling the contents at a discount, forming the Fenwick Weavers' Society.\n\nThere are a plethera of records of co-operatives started out as small grassroots organisations in Western Europe, North America and Japan in the middle of the nineteenth century, however, it is the Rochdale Pioneers that are generally regarded as the prototype of the modern co-operative society and the founders of the Co-operative Movement in 1844.An independently formulated co-operative model developed in Germany by Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen and Franz Hermann Schultz-Delitsch.

    "### Validity of Legal Signatures in Brazil and Around the World\n\nWith the increasing digitalization of administrative and legal processes, the validity of electronic signatures has become a topic of great relevance. Digital signatures offer security, agility, and convenience, but it is essential to understand their legal basis both in Brazil and in other countries. In this article, we explore the legal validity of digital signatures in a global context.\n\n#### Legal Signatures in Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, the validity of electronic signatures is provided for by [Provisional Measure No. 2,200-2/2001](https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/MPV/Antigas_2001/2200-2.htm), which established the Brazilian Public Key Infrastructure (ICP-Brasil). This measure establishes that digitally signed documents using certificates issued by accredited authorities have the same legal validity as physically signed documents.\n\n**Article 10 of MP 2,200-2/2001:**\n\"Electronic documents referred to in this Provisional Measure, whose signatures were made using a digital certificate issued by an accredited Certification Authority, are considered public or private documents.\"\n\nAdditionally, [Law No. 14,063/2020](https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2019-2022/2020/Lei/L14063.htm) brought important updates on the use of electronic signatures in the public sector, classifying them into three types: simple, advanced, and qualified, with the latter having the highest level of security and legal validity.\n\n#### Legal Signatures Around the World\n\nThe regulation of electronic signatures varies from country to country, but there is a global movement towards their acceptance and validation.\n\n##### European Union\n\nIn the European Union, the [eIDAS Regulation](https://s.librecode.coop/e-idas-regulation) (Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services), in effect since 2016, standardizes the use of electronic signatures among Member States. The eIDAS recognizes three types of electronic signatures: simple, advanced, and qualified, with the latter being the only one that has legal equivalence to handwritten signatures.\n\n**Article 25 of the eIDAS Regulation:**\n\"A qualified electronic signature shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten signature.\"\n\n##### United States\n\nIn the United States, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act ([E-SIGN Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/106th-congress/house-bill/1714)) and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) establish that electronic signatures are legally valid and enforceable, provided that all parties involved in the contract opt to use electronic means.\n\n**Section 101(a) of the E-SIGN Act:**\n\"A signature, contract, or other record relating to such transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.\"\n\n#### Benefits of Digital Signatures\n\nThe adoption of digital signatures offers several benefits for businesses and institutions:\n\n1. **Security:** They use encryption to ensure the authenticity and integrity of documents.\n2. **Efficiency:** They reduce the time required to sign and process documents.\n3. **Sustainability:** They decrease paper usage, contributing to more sustainable practices.\n\n\nDigital signatures represent a significant advancement in the way documents are managed and authenticated. Their legal validity is supported by specific laws both in Brazil and in other countries, providing security and efficiency for businesses and individuals.\n\nFor more information on the validity of digital signatures in Brazil, visit [ICP-Brasil](http://www.iti.gov.br/icp-brasil) and [Law No. 14,063/2020](https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2019-2022/2020/Lei/L14063.htm).\n": "### Validity of Legal Signatures in Brazil and Around the World\n\nWith the increasing digitalization of administrative and legal processes, the validity of electronic signatures has become a topic of great relevance.
